					"text": "When a writer wishes to receive their ETH back, they call a Withdraw function of the contract and burn writeETH tokens. ETH will be sent to the writer’s Ethereum address. Attention: do not send writeETH tokens to the contract address because you will lose your funds. 20% of the ETH liquidity pool is always available for withdrawals by providers and can't be locked on new options contracts. If there are not enough funds in the pool to withdraw all of your liquidity, you will have to wait for the options contracts expirations and do it after the liquidity is unlocked and back to the pool."

				{
					"title": "What are the Risks?",
					"text": "You can lose up to 100% of the amount that you will provide to the ETH Liquidity Pool. Selling ETH Call Options exposes liquidity providers' capital to potentially unlimited losses. There is a technical risk that the ETH Liquidity Pool contract can be hacked in the future. Never provide ETH to the ETH Pool than you can't afford to lose."

				{
					"title": "How Premiums are Distributed?",
					"text": "Premiums are paid in ETH by the ETH call options buyers and accumulated on the ETH Pool contract. Each time a new buyer pays the premium, the price of writeETH tokens increases. Remember that the premiums are distributed to the liquidity providers only after the options contracts expiration. Because of that each writeETH token can give a right to withdraw more ETH from the ETH pool contract."

				{
					"title": "How Losses are Distributed?",
					"text": "Each time an ETH call option holder exercises a contract early with losses to the ETH Pool liqudity providers, the price of writeETH tokens decreases. Because of that each writeETH token can give a right to withdraw less ETH from the ETH Pool contract."
